# Movie Review Pro - Crafted with Ionic and Angular

A robust and integrated mobile app experience, this project is an extension of its initial prototype introduced in Assignment 1. At its core, the application emphasises data persistence, ensuring that the information in your editable lists remains consistent across various app launches. By harnessing the power of the Ionic Storage module, users can expect reliable data management. Furthermore, diverse user input mechanisms, such as text, radio buttons, checkboxes, datetime, and number entries, are adeptly integrated to cater to various data entry needs.

One of the standout features is the dynamic list functionality, which not only comes pre-populated but also offers the flexibility of seamless item addition and removal. In addition, the real-time data visualisation offered by the integration of Chart.js ensures that users remain informed about the app's evolving data patterns.

Behind the scenes, the application's architecture is optimised for performance. Shared functionalities and storage access have been efficiently managed through dedicated services. And adding a touch of customisation, a distinct component, specifically tailored to enhance the app's overall feel, ensures a unique user experience. Final touches like a valid icon, splash screen, app ID, and a recognisable name underscore the professionalism of this project.

Designed to be platform-friendly, the application is primed for Android and iOS, ready for showcasing its capabilities on an emulator or an actual device. Moreover, with the inclusion of advanced Angular features such as Observables, this app stands as a testament to contemporary design and user-centric functionalities.
